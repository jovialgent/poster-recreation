# Overview

This is a repo for me to just play around with recreating posters using CSS and HTML. I am use Svelte just because it is easy and these are more or less static posters so I don't need to really care about a super hard and intense framework. I linked to the original posters in [Design Inspiration](https://www.designspiration.com/) and please support them if you like it. This is purely for fun and to challenge my CSS Skills.

# Overview

This is a repo for me to just play around with recreating posters using CSS and HTML. I am use Svelte just because it is easy and these are more or less static posters so I don't need to really care about a super hard and intense framework. This is purely for fun and to challenge my CSS Skills. Below are all the original posters and links to where you can go to see more of the artists' work.
